\subsection*{A Few Definitions and Theorems from Sections 4.7, 4.8, 2.3}

	\begin{itemize}
    	\item \Emph{Newton's Method:} Given $x_0$ and a differentiable function $f(x)$, a solution to $f(x)=0$ is estimated with:
        
         $$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}, \quad n= 0, 1, 2, \ldots$$
        
        \item \Emph{An antiderivative:} The function $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$ if $F'(x) = f(x)$. 
      
        
        \item \Emph{Indefinite Integral:} The set of all antiderivatives is defined as the \Emph{indefinite integral} 
        
        $$\int f(x) dx = F(x) + C$$
        
        $C$ is a constant, $f(x)$ is the \Emph{integrand}, $\int$ is an \Emph{integral sign}, and $dx$ is a differential that indicates the variable over which we are integrating. 
        
        \item A \Emph{differential equation} is an equation that involves derivatives. 
        
        \item A \Emph{solution} to a differential equation is a function that satisfies the differential equation. 
        
        \item A differential equation of the form $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t)$ subject to the condition $y(t_0) = y_0$ is an \Emph{initial value problem}.

    	\begin{itemize}
        	\item 0 marks for no work
        	\item 1 mark for starting the problem or for a final answer with insufficient justification
        	\item 2 marks for a complete solution

    \end{itemize}
    

\subsection*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use Newton's Method to estimate a root of $f(x) = -3x^3 +5x^2 -1$. Start with $x_0 = 1$ and calculate $x_2$. If it is not possible to do so, state why. \vspace{3cm}
    
    \item Solve the initial value problem: $\displaystyle y'(t) = \frac{3}{t+1} + \tan t \sec^2 t, \quad y(0) = 1$. \vspace{4cm}
    
    \item Evaluate $\displaystyle \int \left( e^{3x} + \sin(2 \pi x) \right) \,dx$. Check your work by differentiating your result. \vspace{3cm}
    
    \item Evaluate using the precise definition of limit: $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 3 } 4x -5$.
